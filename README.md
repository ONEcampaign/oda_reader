# oda_reader
Tools to import data from the OECD DAC. 

This is a very simple package to make working with the Explorer API
easier. 

This package is under active development.


It includes a basic implementation of an API call for DAC1 and DAC2a. It also includes
tools to translate the API response into the old .Stat schema.
